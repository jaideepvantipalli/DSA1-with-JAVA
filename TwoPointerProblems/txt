Using two pointer

Dear Students 
Today as part of competitive coding, we have discussed the following coding problems based on two pointer algorithm 

Today's problems are.. 

TWO SUM PROBLEM AND FIND ALL PAIRS : 

1. You are given an array of n integers which are distinct and unsorted. Now, we are also given a target. Find and return all pairs where sum equals to target. ( 3 methods ) .

SORT AN ARRAY OF 0'S , 1'S, 2'S :

7. We are given an array of n elements which are zeroes, ones, twos. Now sort the elements and return array.( 2 methods  ).

SORT ARRAY BY PARITY: 

9. We are given array of numbers ( integers) .now move all even numbers to beginning of array and all odd numbers placed after even numbers. Return modified array. ( 2 methods).
